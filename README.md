# 📘 System Design Codes & Notes

This is my personal, structured roadmap to master **System Design** — starting from **Low-Level Design (LLD)**, advancing to **High-Level Design (HLD)**, and finally integrating **AI Systems** in production-ready architectures.

## 🏗 Phase 2: High-Level Design (HLD) 

Designing scalable distributed systems used by millions. Will cover:

### 📌 Concepts:
- What is System Design?
- CAP Theorem, Consistency Models
- Monolith vs Microservices
- Load Balancing, Scaling
- Caching, Consistent Hashing
- SQL vs NoSQL, Indexing, Sharding
- Messaging Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- API Gateway, Rate Limiting
- CDN, Logging, Monitoring

### 🛠️ Real Systems to Design:
- URL Shortener
- Social Media Feed
- Food Delivery App
- Video Streaming Platform
- Messaging Appliaction
- Text Editor

## 🤖 Phase 3: AI + System Design Integration (Future Phase)

Bringing intelligence to systems using modern AI techniques.

### 🔗 Includes:
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Model Serving with FastAPI, BentoML
- Vector Databases: Weaviate, Qdrant, FAISS
- Agentic Systems: LangGraph, CrewAI
- Feature Stores: Feast
- Monitoring with Evidently, Prometheus

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repo

This repository helps me (and others) track a complete system design journey especially for:
- Cracking system design interviews 
- Designing real-world scalable apps
- Deploying intelligent AI-enabled systems
